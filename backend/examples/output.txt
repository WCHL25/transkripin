Web3 is the future, but it's still much harder to use than Web2.  The industry is fragmented across many blockchains,  forcing Web3 builders to choose between difficult compromises  in centralization versus usability.  These compromises were only necessary  because Web3 was incomplete.  In May 2021, this all changed  with the launch of the Internet Computer Protocol, or ICP.  ICP is a decentralized cloud that bridges the gap between Web2 and Web3.  To create ICP, over 100 cryptographers work for eight years  to perfect an utterly new cryptography innovation.  It's called chain key technology.  But before we explain how it works,  let's quickly look at the incredible things ICP can do.  First, let's explore how decentralized applications on ICP  compare with Web2 applications.  ICP has a powerful new type of smart contract called "Canisters."  They are decentralized web servers  that can directly host full websites with low latency.  Canisters can store up to 400 gigabytes of data,  perform complex calculations,  and connect to Web2 services and APIs without oracles.  Users don't pay gas on ICP.  When canisters do computations,  they burn a token called "cycles" from a built-in wallet.  This process is called a reverse gas model.  Gas costs on ICP usually get paid by the core teams or dows  that own the canisters,  but some daps collect assets to cover their gas costs themselves.  The cycles needed to run canisters can only be minted  by burning ICP tokens,  and the mint ratio gets stabilized  against the real-world costs of running the physical nodes  that are doing the computation.  The cost of hosting daps on ICP is consistent and inexpensive,  regardless of whether the price of ICP tokens goes up or down.  The result is that canisters can deliver decentralized web experiences  that look and feel indistinguishable from Web2.  Next, let's look into how ICP connects with the Web3 world.  Most Web3 blockchains require bridges to connect to other chains.  Bridges are built by deploying spark contracts on each chain  and relaying transactions between them.  Relaying transactions across chains often involves  expensive cryptography computation,  multi-sig wallets between trusted parties and off-chain oracles.  The complicated architecture of Web3 bridges  makes them slow, costly,  difficult to use, and prone to security breaches.  ICP canisters can directly sign transactions on other blockchains,  such as Bitcoin and Ethereum,  without bridges or centralized service providers.  Canisters can mint ordinals on Bitcoin,  deploy smart contracts on Ethereum,  and do anything a human user can do across different Web3 blockchains,  effectively making them decentralized autonomous Web3 users.  The result is that ICP can abstract a way the complexity  of multi-chain transactions  so that users can enjoy a seamless Web3 experience.  Chainkey technology, the alien tech-powering ICP,  makes these incredible capabilities possible.  To understand Chainkey,  let's review how typical Web3 secret keys work.  When a Web3 user wants to create a new blockchain transaction,  they sign a message to the blockchain,  using a secret key that only they know.  A threshold signature is when one secret key gets broken up into pieces  held by different nodes in a network.  Together, these nodes can collectively sign messages  without ever revealing the entire secret key to any node in the network.  Governments and militaries have been using threshold cryptography  to protect their most valuable secrets since the 90s.  However, these organizations only execute threshold signatures  within controlled private networks.  Blockchain networks must be public, trustless, and decentralized.  Web3 nodes might be offline or malicious,  and an attacker might even try to collect the pieces of the secret key over time.  Secure threshold signatures on Web3 were impossible  until the Divinity Foundation invented Chainkey technology.  With Chainkey, up to one-third of nodes could be offline or malicious,  and the network can still generate a secure signature.  The pieces of the secret key stored on each node are also constantly scrambling,  so that any information leaked from a node is useless to attackers.  This makes it possible to create a decentralized network  that can use secret keys no human or computer will ever know.  Divinity built ICP on top of Chainkey technology  to completely reimagine what an L1 blockchain could be,  with the vision of creating a fully decentralized internet.  For example, anyone can verify the content received from the internet computer  by simply validating a signature without syncing the entire blockchain.  In addition, 0% of ICP nodes run on AWS or other big tech cloud providers.  ICP nodes are themselves independent private clouds  running in data centers all over the world.  Furthermore, nodes on ICP only act as vendors for an on-chain doubt  that manages an ICP network called the Network Nervous System, or NNS.  ICP holders who stake tokens in the NNS are the only ones  who can control the source code of the network,  and they can collectively update the network without hard forks.  ICP is entirely alien to anything else within Web2 or Web3,  which makes it perfect for connecting the two in ways never possible before.  With Bitcoin, humanity got the first decentralized network.  With Ethereum, humanity got the first decentralized logic.  With ICP, humanity now has the first decentralized secret keys,  the first decentralized cloud, and the first decentralized AI models.  Oh, yeah, did we mention that ICP is the only blockchain  that can fully host AI models on chain?  Now that is Alien Tech.  The future of the Internet belongs to everyone,  and it won't be harder to use.  Whatever blockchains you love and whatever Web3 future you're fighting for,  ICP's Alien Tech will be a part of it.  Explore what ICP has to offer and take your place in the Web3 invasion.
